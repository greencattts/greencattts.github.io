            <p> Since its release on the Nintendo 64 more than two decades ago, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has remained a phenomenon in the nexus of gamer culture
                very largely due to the impact it would have on games to come.
                The game takes much inspiration from the childhood of Shigeru Miyamoto and his time exploring the wilderness and caves in his home of Kyoto, Japan.
                A complex and deep game, the depth of the gameplay cannot be overlooked -
                the eponymous Ocarina remains the center of several different phenomena in the game’s narratives and mechanics, and constitutes one of the first ever games to use memory and rhythm in a fantasy action-adventure game.

            The opening sequence can’t be described as anything but evocative. Greeted by the galloping of a horse, a soft piano fades in and is then joined by a melancholic string of ocarina notes.
            The camera pans over a landscape while the sun rises before the press start button appears. Composer Koji Kondo’s score ranges from triumphant to sorrowful, following Link’s journey from child to adult. 
            The ocarina is able to be played with the A and B buttons, along with the four C button: playing songs and melodies on the ocarina allows the player to summon storms, befriend animals and heal characters.
            Iconic and memorable tunes such as Saria's Song or Zelda's Lullaby instaly bring back memories for any fan of the genre.

            Link is a child growing up in the Kokiri Forest, a hidden place inhabited by The Kokiri, a race of small child-like beings.
            Plagued by concerning dreams, Link awakes to find he is not a Kokiri but an orphaned Hylian boy, and that he has been tasked with destroying the Gerudo King Ganondorf, a wicked man who has recently escaped from his seven-year imprisonment and is intent on capturing the Triforce and ruling the world.
            Entering a time skip, Link awakes seven years older to find the beautiful, lush world he once knew devastated and inhabited with monsters.

            Ocarina of Time was one of the first 3D games to be released, and as such it pioneered many of mechanics and interface concepts. Navigation across the land of Hyrule is an incredibly important part of the game, much like puzzle solving, the other main mechanic of the game.
            Puzzles come in many different shapes and forms, but are typically most apparent in the dungeons of the game; it is here where Link must fight enemies and bosses to gather new items which without them would render progression insurmountable. 
            Perhaps one of the biggest innovations Ocarina of Time brought to the table was the utilization of Z-targeting, which is the ability to lock onto a specific enemy
            in order to direct your blows to one of multiple enemies and has become an industry wide standard.

            Platforming is another part of the game which is essential to traversing Hyrule, especially given that there is no jump button to hurdle over jumps and bridges, but how Miyamoto handles this is genius.
            When running towards an edge, Link will jump. However, if the player slowly walks Link over an edge, he will fall and grab onto it, granting the chance for the player to climb back. 
            The further you progress into the game, the more complex the mechanics become. The use of movement and timing becomes paramount, as there is now a sense of urgency.
            Items like the Hookshot and the Levitation Boots are now required to progress through certain parts of the game, while garments like Tunics grant access to certain parts of the game that are inaccessible without them.

            Ocarina of Time had such a profound effect on video games and that’s why it remains one of the most eminently playable games today -
            the way designers pushed the limits of early polygonal gaming, the brilliance of the overall design and the small intracacies of the characters motivations all come together to just work.
            A story of hope, sorrow and regret, Ocarina of Time is a game that got things truly right – a compelling storyline, fluid combat, expertly crafted dungeons and a soundtrack that evoked emotions like no other.
